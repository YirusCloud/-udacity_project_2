The LRU cache use linked list to maintin the least-recently-used structure and a hash map or dictionary to retrieve items in the cache.

Time Complexity: The use of two pointers in the DLL allows to insert a new item ( head ) and remove the least-recently-used item ( tail ) in constant time: O(1) . Similarly, the dictionary data structure executes the look-up operation in O(1) time.

Space Complexity: As in terms of space complexity, the structures require O(n), where n is the number of elements in the cache. In the worst-case scenario n = c, where c is the capacity of the cache.
